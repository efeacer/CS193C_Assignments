			I am a student in <span>Stanford</span> Summer Session. I am currently taking two courses
			from the <span>Stanford</span> Computer Science Department. These courses are CS106B (Programming
			abstractions) and CS193C (Client-side Internet Technologies).
		</p>
		<p>
			I am from Turkey. I live in Ankara, which is the capital city of Turkey. I am studying in Bilkent University which is one of
			 the best universities in the land. My major is Electrical and Electronical Engineering. However, I am really into coding, 
			 that's why I came to <span>Stanford</span> for this summer. I heard that 
			<span>Stanford</span> is the best university for coding. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My programming skills involve java coding. I made my own game in java, back in this year and I coded 
			many desktop applications. I am into competitive programming as well (solving math problems with the 
			help of programming etc.) I am planning to improve my programming skills here in <span>Stanford</span>
			University. I am learning C++ and web design languages right now and I am really enjoying
			them, I think <span>Stanford</span> is the right place to learn those languages.
		</p>

				Besides coding, I like sports. I was a swimmer when I was in middle school. I actually came to 	<span>Stanford</span> for
				a swimming camp six years ago (<span>Stanford</span> swimming team was good). I quit swimming three years ago. 
				Then, I did martial arts and boxing. I hit the gym a lot as well. Here is a list of my hobies:
